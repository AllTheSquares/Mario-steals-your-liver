# Mario steals your liver
Silly program that makes the joke video into a real thing. 

This repository contains the contents and the scripts required for this program to work. You can build this program on your own time, or you can probably check branches.

Be warned: Mario truly means it when he says he will get your liver. By all means be sure to save everything important before executing this program (either built or unbuilt), as your computer WILL SHUT DOWN once all is done. LAUNCH AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This program was built on Windows for Windows in mind.

Features: 
 > Initial Tkinter popup that looks like a Windows error as seen in the commonly-shared image on the internet.

 > You cannot close out of the program without using Task Manager. 

 > The cancel button doesn't work. You have no other choice.
 
 > Clicking the OK button will start a random timer. It will take up to a minute for the main payload to execute.
 
 > Your computer will shut down at the conclusion of the payload.
