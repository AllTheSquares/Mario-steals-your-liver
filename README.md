# Mario steals your liver
Program built on Python that makes the joke image/video on the internet into a real program.

This brannch contains a Windows executable as was created by PyInstaller. If you want the source Python scripts, please check main.

Warnings:
- A distorted audio file of the meme in question will play. Please lower your computer's volume. :)
- This program was created with no intention to startle or scare you, BUT it may do the aforementioned as it does catch you off guard. 
- **Run this program at your own risk.** This program is not malware, although be warned that Mario will shut down your computer once he steals your liver. Therefore, it is a good idea to save all important files before running this program/script. 

Notes:
- Depending on the antivirus/antimalware program you have installed (such as Windows Defender), this executable may be flagged as a trojan. Do not worry if this program is quarantined or deleted by this false-positive. This is probably an issue on PyInstaller's end. 

Features: 
 > Initial Tkinter popup that looks like a Windows error as seen in the commonly-shared image on the internet.

 > You cannot close out of the program without using Task Manager. 

 > The cancel button doesn't work. You have no other choice.
 
 > Clicking the OK button will start a random timer. It will take up to a minute for the main payload to execute.
 
 > Your computer will shut down at the conclusion of the payload.
